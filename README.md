# Partition GUID Changer

This can change the disk and partition GUIDs of a gpt partitioned drive. Do not use on a Windows boot drive unless you are an advanced technical user and you know how to change the relevant BCD entries. Only works on disk with a logical block size of 512 (the vast majority of consumer disks satisfy this criterion.)
